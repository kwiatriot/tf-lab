# Terraform Lab

This code was insipred by a challenge I found on You Tube you can find the link [here](https://youtu.be/UQN2WrNYvXs)!

## About the code

This is currently a mass of resources in a single `main.tf` file. I will be modifying this repo to utilize better coding practices. So there will be new branches from time to time and once those are verified working, I will push them to main.
